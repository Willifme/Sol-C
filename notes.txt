Make the AST this way:

Create the header file and implementation file (ast.h, ast.c)

Create a central "Node" struct which has an enum for the different node types,
function for node specific data and allowance for children.

Then define "Node constructors" e.g. Int, String etc.

Assign everything to "$$" in the bison file.
